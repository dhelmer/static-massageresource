## MASSAGERESOURCE.COM Static Github Web Page

This repo houses the web content for the [https://www.massageresource.com](www.massageresource.com) website.

The site first appeared online in 1996 and was a general-purpose massage therapy resource for both therapists looking for educational and training resources, and individuals looking for therapeutic massage practitioners. The earliest version of the site also housed a large forum community ... but then forum spam became a thing and that feature was removed from the site.

Of course, all of this was merely value-added content to disguise the true purpose of the website which was to promote the sale of *The Massage Therapy Career Focus Workbook* written by this repo's owner and his co-author and friend, David Lemke.

The workbook sold reasonably well across North America and several massage schools adopted it as required reading, but sales slowly started to decline after a decade of brisk sales. Both of the authors had moved onto other pursuits so the decision was made to make the book free to read online.

This Github Pages version of the workbook continues the authors' wish to keep the workbook free to read online, but in no way should be construed as an invitiation to others to resell it in whole or in part.
